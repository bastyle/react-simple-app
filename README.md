# COMP 308 Assignment 1
## Bastian Bastias 
Purpose:	The purpose of this assignment is to:
•	Become familiar with modern front-end frameworks
•	Become familiar with function components
•	Develop a UI using React


References:	Read the reference textbook, lecture slides, and class examples. This material provides the necessary information that you need to complete the exercises.

Be sure to read the following general instructions carefully:
- This assignment must be completed individually by all the students.
- See the naming and submission rules at the end of this document
- You will have to provide an demonstration for your solution in class and upload the solution on eCentennial through the assignment link.

Exercise 1

Create a UI that allows students to evaluate their courses. You will have to provide a login form to allow the students to login, a comments form to allow the students to enter the comments, and the Thank You form. The login form should accept the student’s email address) and password.

The comments form should automatically populate the email field with the student’s email value entered in login form and allow the student to enter the course code, course name, and comments. Provide also two other fields in this form that will be different for each student. For example, you may create fields for a favorite topic, favorite assignment, strongest technical skill obtained in this course, etc. The Thank You form should thank the user for providing the comments.
Implement a folder structure for your application similar to class examples. Design nice and friendly forms.




# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
